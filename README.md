## Description:
The goal of this website was to optimize the website by using HTML semantics and ultimately, make it more accessible to users through different search engines.

## Installation:
I used to the SSH clone procedure to install the repository and edit it on VSCODE.

## Changes Made:
I changed most of the original HTML to the semantics HTML so that not all of the tags were divs. I also compressed redundant code in the CSS file.

## What is should look like:
